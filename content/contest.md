# The Contest

The Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest (BAPC) is a contest in which teams from leading universities in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are served a series of algorithmic problems/puzzles. The goal of each team is to solve the most puzzles as possible within the set time limit. Solutions need to be programmed out on a computer and can be submitted to a semi-automated judging system, after which the solution is checked.

The teams that have solved the most puzzles at the end of the contest qualify for the <a href="https://2022.nwerc.eu/" target="_blank">Northwestern European Regional Contest (NWERC)</a>. In this regional competition the teams can qualify themselves for a ticket to the <a href="https://icpc.global/" target="_blank">International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)</a>, also known as the World Finals.

The BAPC 2022 is hosted by the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/" target="_blank">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>, and organized by a committee of <a href="https://gewis.nl/" target="_blank">study association GEWIS</a>.
